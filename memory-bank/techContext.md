# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
- **ECMAScript (JavaScript):** The core language for the framework. The implementation will leverage JavaScript's object model, specifically prototypal inheritance.

## Development Setup
The development environment is straightforward, with the entire framework's code residing in a single file: `framework.js`. There are no other specified build tools, dependencies, or complex setup procedures at this stage.

## Technical Constraints
- **Browser-based:** The framework is designed to run exclusively in web browsers.
- **No Dependencies:** The project brief implies a dependency-free framework.
