# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to create a reusable framework that simplifies the development of web applications, specifically those with rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The goal is to provide a foundational set of tools for developers to build interactive experiences more efficiently.

## Problems It Solves
The framework addresses the complexity of building interactive web UIs. It provides a standardized and simple way to handle common GUI element manipulations, such as moving and resizing, which can be tedious and repetitive to implement from scratch for each new project.

## How It Should Work
The core of the framework is a special mode that can be toggled on or off by the user (e.g., via a menu item or keyboard shortcut). When this mode is active, GUI elements become directly manipulable. Users can click and drag elements to change their position or size. The use of modifier keys allows for different types of manipulations on the same element, providing a flexible and powerful editing capability directly within the application.

## User Experience Goals
The primary user experience goal is to provide developers with an intuitive and efficient workflow for creating and modifying web UIs. For the end-users of applications built with this framework, the goal is a seamless and predictable interaction model for manipulating on-screen elements where that functionality is exposed.
