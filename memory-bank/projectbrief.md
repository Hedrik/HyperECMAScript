This file describes the underlying framework that allows for ease of development of applications that run on web clients. (browsers)  The framework uses ECMAScript (Javascript) prototypes with inheritance to enable all GUI elements to be manipulated with simple click-and-drag inputs, with modifier keys used to select from changing position or changing size or changing other settings that are specific to the element being manipulated.  This functionality is available as a separate mode which is toggled on and off with a menu item or keystroke binding.  These features are implemented in the file named "framework.js"
